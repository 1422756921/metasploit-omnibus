This will install Metasploit Framework and its dependencies on your Mac.

--------------------------------------------------

The framework itself will be installed under /opt/metasploit/framework. Convenience wrappers for the commands are installed under /opt/metasploit/bin, which can be added to your PATH environment variable.

This is an unofficial installer and a work in progress. Some features may not work yet.

If you are interested in Metasploit Framework development, see

Thank you for using Metasploit! Have a fantastic day!
